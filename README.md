App Description:
Application will help track and log progress in developing skills. User will be able to track the amount of time put into learning and practicing a skill. Goals, milestones, and positive reinforcement features will be added. The key is to use effective UI and visualization to make the app easy to use and turn into a habit.  

Describe one user case: 
User decides they want to start learning to paint. They can create a new object for that skill. While theyâ€™re learning or practicing, they can either time it live or log the time later on. The app will store the total amount, perhaps in categories (i.e., practice, learning, etc.) and visualize the figures with charts. This will make it easier to see plateaus or inconsistency. After 20 hours spent painting, the user will achieve a milestone showing a quote or article about how the first 20 hours spent on a skill are the most meaningful.
